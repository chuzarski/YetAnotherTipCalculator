Yet Another Tip Calculator
==========================
This is yet another tip calculator app. I made this app to learn first hand how to deploy an app to the Play Store. Another useful reason for this app is, well, calculating tips.

I also want to release the source for this app for people who are new to Android development (like myself) who would like to see what the code for a simple app looks like

So go ahead! Look away and learn what you can :-)
